Assignment to run 2002 Whitney Museum's software artworks

# ABSTRACT
This report provides an analysis of 12 works in which artists developed software-based art pieces for an event held at the Whitney Museum in 2002. Due to the time elapsed, many of the programming languages used have become obsolete or have undergone significant updates, leading to incompatibility issues with modules and libraries. This work aims to reproduce these artworks using current technologies, employing 3 different strategies:
1.Execution in a modern environment: For languages still in use, scripts were run on personal computers with updated versions.
2.Transpilation: Some scripts were translated into modern languages with equivalent features to preserve the artistic intent of the work.
3.Use of virtual machines (VM): In cases where the languages are no longer in use, virtual machines were set up to faithfully replicate the original environment.

It is important to note that while cloud-based environments were not considered for code reproduction, this option is viewed as a potential strategy.

# INTRODUCTION

In 2002, the Whitney Museum of American Art presented an exhibition of software-based artworks, highlighting how artists use code to create interactive and innovative pieces. These works, known as software-based artworks, use software as a creative tool, merging programming, interactivity, and aesthetics in new forms of artistic expression.
However, the preservation of these pieces presents a significant challenge, as over time, technologies, languages, libraries, and execution environments are constantly evolving and, in some cases, become obsolete, threatening both the preservation and the ability to experience the works in their original form.
This report analyzes the 12 pieces presented at the event, evaluating a set of strategies for each specific case, including: execution in the original language, transpilation to modern languages, use of virtual machines (VM) emulating original platforms, and packaging in isolated containers.
The report documents the entire research and execution process. The content is organized into sections that include: a development section for each artwork, detailing the process followed; a summary of the results obtained; conclusions derived from the analysis; and the references consulted.
