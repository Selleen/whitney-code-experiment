How To Hack Hotmail Passwords



This is the best way to hack anyone's Hotmail password. First, open a

new email message. Type in the "To:" box this email address:

passwd_bot@hotmail.com. This is the email robot that Hotmail staffers

use to check user accounts. In the subject line, type "CHK PASSWD" (type

this in upper case *exactly* as shown). In the body, type on the 1st

line your hotmail address (ex: you@hotmail.com). On the 2nd line, type

your password. And on the 3rd line, type the email address you want to

hack (ex: them@hotmail.com).



You must add ";" (no quotes!) at the end of each line so their server

will process it as a command.



Here is an example of what the email should look like:



	To: passwd_bot@hotmail.com 

	Subject: CHK PASSWD



	You@hotmail.com;

	12345678;

	Them@hotmail.com;



The security hole has been well documented on BugTraq, but those lamers

at Hotmail haven't fixed it yet. Get it while you can! :-P
